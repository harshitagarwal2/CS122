class A
{
   public:
      void show();
}

class B
{
   public:
       void show();

}


Though the signature appears to be same, they are actully different. The function 
prototypes in respective classes are actually as follows(as per the discussion w.r.t
this pointer)

void show(A * const);
void show(B * const);
